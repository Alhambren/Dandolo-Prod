## Completion Verification Process

1. **Self-Assessment**: Agent reviews all criteria
2. **Peer Review**: Another agent validates completion
3. **Quality Gate Check**: Automated validation where possible
4. **Stakeholder Sign-off**: Required approvals obtained
5. **Final Verification**: Master orchestrator confirms completion

## Failure Handling

If completion criteria are not met:
1. Document specific failures
2. Estimate effort to remediate
3. Re-assign to appropriate agent if needed
4. Update task timeline and dependencies
5. Notify stakeholders of delay
6. Implement corrective actions
7. Re-verify completion criteria
